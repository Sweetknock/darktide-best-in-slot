  "Description": [
   "Junk? Oo called it junk? Extra special club, this is. My own design. I got two meself just like it - Gurry \"Brunt\" Cernik.",
   "Used by officers of the Astra Militarum throughout the galaxy, this heavy laspistol packs a considerable punch.",
   "Accatran lasguns are typified by their short, almost carbine like profile, and high rate of fire, which make them ideal for use in the confines of boarding actions, cityfights, or trench warfare.",
   "The Accatran Mk VI Series is an evolutionary offshoot of the Mk IV, so beloved of the Elysian Drop Troops. The improved rate of fire comes from its more efficient charge pack at the expense of stopping power.",
   "They say the lasgun is a \"humble\" weapon. I say it's the most efficient tool in the galaxy. Billions of liberated souls can't be wrong. - Lord Militant Ennic Baross",
   "The Achlys Mk I Power Maul is a new weapon that was added shortly post release.",
   "Tough hardly a graceful weapon, many a duellist has met their end after practicing fancy swordplay on an axe-wielding zealot.",
   "Unsubtle weapons, known for their excessive kick and bright muzzle flash, Agripinaa autoguns are still popular due to their stopping power and reliability.",
   "Exchanging the iron sights of the better known Agripinaa autogun for heavy stock and counter-balanced barrel, this weapon is well-suited for mowing down hordes of foes.",
   "One of the newest autogun STCs to be uncovered by the Tech-Priests of Agripinaa, the Mk VIII couples excellent range with a devastating burst firing mode.",
   "Issued to planetary defenders during trench warfare, light axes are used not just for clearing paths and chopping firewood on long campaigns, but also for hacking away at invaders during desperate close actions.",
   "Hailing from the same forge world as the mighty Hellhound flame tank, this weapon uses volatile promethium to scour heretics with fire.",
   "Derived from ancient hunting weapon designs, tactical axes are simple and cheap to produce, and deadly in the hands of a trained warrior.",
   "Axes, hammers, knives, sticks and stones. These are the weapons of humble, working folk. These are the tools of our liberation. - Jax Groll",
   "After seeing the effectiveness of simple axes in small melee actions, the Inquisitors of Crucis ordered a large custom shipment from Atrox with which to equip their strike teams.",
   "A heavy grenade launcher beloved of Bullgryn units, grenadier gauntlets are strapped to their user's arm simply to prevent the slow-witted Ogryn from losing them...",
   "It's a dirty job, but someone's got to do it. And nine times out of ten, that someone is an Ogryn.",
   "In the hands of an Ogryn, these massive, crude cleavers can rend a grown man in half with a single swipe.",
   "With their honed, monomolecular-edged teeth, chainswords are prized within the Astra Militarum, where they are often issued to squad sergeants as a symbol of authority.",
   "The Catachans refer to these massive blades as knives. To everyone else, they're hefty swords.",
   "They say a Catachan Jungle Fighter can take down a full-grown Cudbear with one of these knives. Well, anything they can do, the Moebian 100th can do better! - Major Neena Kolfex",
   "Named after the Catachan Devil, a fearsome predator from the Catachan jungles, this massive blade is the most prized weapon of the eponymous regiment.",
   "Closer to a sword than a knife, the Devil's Claw's blade is hollow and half-filled with mercury, makint it surprisingly lightweight while lending it greater swinging power.",
   "A commander's prime concern is strategy. A soldier's duty is to plant their feet and blaze away. - Lord Militant Ennic Baross",
   "A rarity in the Moebian Domain, Columnus autoguns are prized for their high rate of fire, if somewhat deafening report.",
   "Power weapons of ancient design, Thunder Hammers are devastating, bone-shattering close combat weapons, though heavy and unwieldy.",
   "Through the intricate psi-convectors of a force staff, a Psyker harnesses the pure energy of the warp, unleashing it upon their enemies in ferocious psychic cavalcades.",
   "Let your mind be the weapon. The staff is merely there to light the darkness.",
   "A ripper gun is, in essence, a heavy, automatic shotgun. They are built as simply and solidly as possible, because most Ogryns in the field forget about shooting, instead using whatever they have to hand as improvised melee weapons.",
   "A rare pattern of ripper gun, the Foe-Rend Mk V was an attempt to use a tightly focussed scatter shell to improve the Ogryns' aim at long range. Given the Ogryn propensity for charging widly into combat, the experiment was quickly abandoned.",
   "Compensating for the Ogryns' lack of focus, this ripper gun variant combines a wide scattershot with a semi-auto burst mode, causing very loud, very messy carnage at close range.",
   "They say the forge world be cursed. Ha! Give me a hundred soldiers armed with such weapons, and by the Emperor I say it's the enemy who'll feel the curse! - Captain Jerzy Modamus",
   "Well-regarded for their high rate of fire and sturdy construction, these autoguns are in short supply after a series of calamities befell the forge world of Graia.",
   "The Indignatus Mk IVe Crusher was added to Darktide shortly after the launch of the game.",
   "More popular with hive gangers than Moebian military forces, this autopistol's devastating rate of fire is near-legendary.",
   "++DILIGENCE IS DUTY++",
   "The MG Mk IV was something of a short-lived experiment, sacrificing stopping power in favor of an improved rate of fire.",
   "With its improved charge pack and focussing array, the MG XII is amongst the most powerful lasguns to come out of the manufactorums of Kantrael, albeit somewhat slower to fire than its cousins.",
   "These enourmous blades are almost too heavy for a guardsman to lift, but in the hands of an Ogryn they're little more than lightweight daggers.",
   "Nothing gets an Ogryn's blood up quite like the deafening noise and high-power recoil of a full-auto heavy weapon, and they don't come much louder or more powerful than a twin-linked heavy stubber.",
   "Ogryn likes to slash, slash, slash and more slash!",
   "Based on the ubiquitous weapon long carried by the Adeptus Arbites, this semi-automatic shotgun is deadly at short range.",
   "A variant of an old Adeptus Arbites design, Lock-pattern boltguns are known for their reliability and stopping power.",
   "The orbital manufactorum Lorenz is most well-known for forging heavy ordnance for the Imperial Navy. As a sideline, however, its Tech-Adepts create Ogryn-proof field weapons based on primitive designs.",
   "One of the simplest grenade launchers constructed in the Imperium, \"rumblers\" have more in common with primitive mortars than the usual weaponry made on the Lorenz forge world.",
   "Most Lucius-pattern lasguns operate in the 21 megathoule range, discharging a more powerful shot, but draining their power packs more rapidly.",
   "A more elegant design of the Lucius Mk i. Once the preserve of officers in the Death Korps of Krieg, this aging but reliable model has found its way into the hands of soldiers across the galaxy.",
   "With their extended barrels and bayonet loops, Lucius-pattern lasguns are well-regarded by assault troops who seek out melee after discharging a few volleys.",
   "Firing an energized ball of hydrogen-based plasma along a linear electromagnetic accelerator, plasma guns are deadly, if prone to dangerous overheating.",
   "It is said that Saint Drusus (formerly Lord-General Militant Drusus) was a consummate swordsman, who wielded an ornate duelling sword unto his dying breath.",
   "Maccabian swords are renowned for their light weight, keen edge and ostentatious detailing. The Mk IV is a particular favorite of Navy commanders, Rogue Traders and Lord Inquisitors alike.",
   "Most Imperial swords are simple, heavy affairs, designed for the unskilled NCO to use with lethal effect. Not so Maccabian sabres, which require years of practice to master.",
   "When activated, a power sword is wreathed in a hazy energy field, allowing the blade to slice through armour and flesh alike.",
   "A Force Staff grounds a Psyker, helping them resist daemonic possession.",
   "An elegant weapon, made powerful indeed in the hands of a psyker.",
   "Inspired by the enormous chain weapons employed by the Legio Tempestus titans, Orestes chainaxes are brutal in their simplicity.",
   "Simple but effective, a slab shield turns an Ogryn into a wall of walking cover, near impervious to enemy attacks.",
   "The humble combat axe is an unfashionable but effective weapon, its weighted head often doing far more damage on the swing than the blade itself.",
